# Platform Backend Service

## Overview

This directory is reserved for the future platform backend service that will handle:

- User management and authentication
- Multi-tenant platform administration
- Dashboard and analytics aggregation
- Platform-wide configuration management
- Integration with the core analytics API service

## Planned Architecture

- **Framework**: Node.js with Express/Fastify
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for user data and platform configuration
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with refresh tokens
- **API**: RESTful API with GraphQL for complex queries
- **Deployment**: Independent containerized deployment

## Development Status

ðŸš§ **Not yet implemented** - This is a placeholder for future development.

## Getting Started

This service will be developed as part of the platform expansion phase. When ready for development:

1. Initialize package.json with service-specific dependencies
2. Set up TypeScript configuration extending the root config
3. Implement authentication and user management endpoints
4. Create database migrations and models
5. Set up independent deployment configuration
