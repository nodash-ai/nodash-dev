# Development Utilities

## Overview

This directory is reserved for development tools and utilities that will help with:

- Build and deployment automation
- Development environment setup
- Code generation and scaffolding
- Testing utilities and fixtures
- Monorepo management tools

## Planned Architecture

- **CLI Tools**: Node.js command-line utilities
- **Build Scripts**: Automated build and deployment helpers
- **Code Generators**: Templates and scaffolding tools
- **Testing Utilities**: Shared test fixtures and helpers
- **Monorepo Tools**: Workspace management and coordination

## Development Status

ðŸš§ **Not yet implemented** - This is a placeholder for future development.

## Planned Tools

### `@nodash/cli`
- Command-line interface for common development tasks
- Service scaffolding and code generation
- Database migration and seeding utilities
- Environment setup and configuration

### `@nodash/build-tools`
- Shared build configurations and scripts
- Docker image building and optimization
- Deployment automation utilities
- Asset optimization and bundling

### `@nodash/test-utils`
- Shared test fixtures and mock data
- Testing utilities and helpers
- Integration test setup and teardown
- Performance testing tools

### `@nodash/dev-server`
- Local development server coordination
- Service discovery and proxy setup
- Hot reloading and file watching
- Development environment orchestration

## Getting Started

These development tools will be created as the monorepo grows and common patterns emerge. When ready for development:

1. Create individual tool directories with their own package.json
2. Set up TypeScript configurations for CLI and build tools
3. Implement common development workflows and automation
4. Create documentation and usage guides
5. Integrate tools with existing development processes

## Usage Examples

Once implemented, developers will use these tools for common tasks:

```bash
# Scaffold a new service
npx @nodash/cli create service my-new-service

# Run all services in development mode
npx @nodash/dev-server start

# Build and deploy a specific service
npx @nodash/build-tools deploy api-service

# Generate test fixtures
npx @nodash/test-utils generate fixtures
```

## Related Services

- **All Services**: Will benefit from build and deployment automation
- **All Apps**: Will use development server and testing utilities
- **Monorepo Root**: Will integrate with workspace management
